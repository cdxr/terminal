# Terminal

`terminal` provides TermT, an abstract monad transformer used as an alternative
to the InputT type provided by
[Haskeline](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskeline).

It exports a single module,
[System.Console.Terminal](https://github.com/cdxr/terminal/blob/master/System/Console/Terminal.hs).

Terminal is in very early development.
